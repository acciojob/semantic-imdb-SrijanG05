        <p>
            Pulp Fiction is a non-linear crime masterpiece that weaves together the lives of two hitmen, 
            a boxer, and a gangster's wife. Their stories intersect in a series of funny, bizarre, and 
            violent incidents involving a mysterious briefcase, a diner robbery, and a 
            high-stakes date that goes dangerously wrong.
